      <p class = "bio">My name is Manasa Maddi, and I am currently a junior in high school. I have started becoming involved in the computer science field from the age of 8 as I quickly got involved in robotics, and was intrigued to engage in such activities even more in depth. As I began teaching coding and engineering classes over the summer, held shadowing programs for individuals interested in this field, and began executing multiple outreach projects as a result of wanting to get underprevlieged students involved as well. I hope to get more involved in the near future as well. </p>

      <p class = "bio">Hello! I'm Mehek Bhatnagar, a junior at American High School in Fremont, CA. In the past few years, I have been involved in a few clubs that are dedicated to supporting women in a designated field, such as Girls Who Code. I truly appreciated the work that they did especially since it is trivial that all workspaces have women playing an equal role, and I found it a pleasure to be involved in that. I am been apart of local robotics team where I have contributed to the code team, and gained many valauble skills regarding that aspect. I am excited to be showcasing this website to you all as you can find a range of sight-seeing spots here as well. </p>

    <p class = "bio">I am a current student at American High School. Whether it's a website, community service activity, school club, or just a simple project, I bring a new perspective, prior knowledge of team dynamics and project management, a motivated work ethic, and an open mind. I use my creativity in unique ways to think of great ideas that haven't been done before. I am really excited to be presenting our website to you all as it would be a pleasure to see how you all will use it to find the hotels you would like, in your near proximity. </p>

      <p class = "bio">Hi, my name is Alyssa. I am a student at Punahou School in Honolulu. Ever since I watched Project Mc2 on Netflix when I was 10, I had been interested in coding. I was interested in how people can build such complex software with such a foreign language. After getting older, Youtube rekindled my curiosity for coding. I had then enrolled to Kode with Klossy. Growing up, I learned about feminism at a young age. I beleive that women should get the same opportunities as men and that we need to educate more about the struggles of being a woman and person of color. I dance ballet and enjoy theater and music in general.  </p>
